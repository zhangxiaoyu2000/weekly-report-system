.SH NAME
gh-attestation-download - Download an artifact's attestations for offline use


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgh attestation download [<file-path> | oci://<image-uri>] [--owner | --repo] [flags]\fR


.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS NOTE: This feature is currently in public preview, and subject to change.
Download attestations associated with an artifact for offline use.

.PP
The command requires either:
* a file path to an artifact, or
* a container image URI (e.g. \fBoci://<image-uri>\fR)
  * (note that if you provide an OCI URL, you must already be authenticated with
its container registry)

.PP
In addition, the command requires either:
* the \fB--repo\fR flag (e.g. --repo github/example).
* the \fB--owner\fR flag (e.g. --owner github), or

.PP
The \fB--repo\fR flag value must match the name of the GitHub repository
that the artifact is linked with.

.PP
The \fB--owner\fR flag value must match the name of the GitHub organization
that the artifact's linked repository belongs to.

.PP
Any associated bundle(s) will be written to a file in the
current directory named after the artifact's digest. For example, if the
digest is "sha256:1234", the file will be named "sha256:1234.jsonl".

.PP
Colons are special characters on Windows and cannot be used in
file names. To accommodate, a dash will be used to separate the algorithm
from the digest in the attestations file name. For example, if the digest
is "sha256:1234", the file will be named "sha256-1234.jsonl".
