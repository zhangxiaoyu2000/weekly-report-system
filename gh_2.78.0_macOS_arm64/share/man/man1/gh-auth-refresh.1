.SH NAME
gh-auth-refresh - Refresh stored authentication credentials


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgh auth refresh [flags]\fR


.SH DESCRIPTION
Expand or fix the permission scopes for stored credentials for active account.

.PP
The \fB--scopes\fR flag accepts a comma separated list of scopes you want
your gh credentials to have. If no scopes are provided, the command
maintains previously added scopes.

.PP
The \fB--remove-scopes\fR flag accepts a comma separated list of scopes you
want to remove from your gh credentials. Scope removal is idempotent.
The minimum set of scopes (\fBrepo\fR, \fBread:org\fR, and \fBgist\fR) cannot be removed.

.PP
The \fB--reset-scopes\fR flag resets the scopes for your gh credentials to
the default set of scopes for your auth flow.

.PP
If you have multiple accounts in \fBgh auth status\fR and want to refresh the credentials for an
inactive account, you will have to use \fBgh auth switch\fR to that account first before using
this command, and then switch back when you are done.

.PP
