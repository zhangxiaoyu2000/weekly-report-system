.SH NAME
gh-extension-install - Install a gh extension from a repository


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgh extension install <repository> [flags]\fR


.SH DESCRIPTION
Install a GitHub CLI extension from a GitHub or local repository.

.PP
For GitHub repositories, the repository argument can be specified in
\fBOWNER/REPO\fR format or as a full repository URL.
The URL format is useful when the repository is not hosted on \fBgithub.com\fR\&.

.PP
For remote repositories, the GitHub CLI first looks for the release artifacts assuming
that it's a binary extension i.e. prebuilt binaries provided as part of the release.
In the absence of a release, the repository itself is cloned assuming that it's a
script extension i.e. prebuilt executable or script exists on its root.

.PP
The \fB--pin\fR flag may be used to specify a tag or commit for binary and script
extensions respectively, the latest version is used otherwise.

.PP
For local repositories, often used while developing extensions, use \fB\&.\fR as the
value of the repository argument. Note the following:
.IP \(bu 2
After installing an extension from a locally cloned repository, the GitHub CLI will
manage this extension as a symbolic link (or equivalent mechanism on Windows) pointing
to an executable file with the same name as the repository in the repository's root.
For example, if the repository is named \fBgh-foobar\fR, the symbolic link will point
to \fBgh-foobar\fR in the extension repository's root.
.IP \(bu 2
When executing the extension, the GitHub CLI will run the executable file found
by following the symbolic link. If no executable file is found, the extension
will fail to execute.
.IP \(bu 2
If the extension is precompiled, the executable file must be built manually and placed
in the repository's root.

.PP
