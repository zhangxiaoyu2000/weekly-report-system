.SH NAME
gh-repo-clone - Clone a repository locally


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgh repo clone <repository> [<directory>] [-- <gitflags>...]\fR


.SH DESCRIPTION
Clone a GitHub repository locally. Pass additional \fBgit clone\fR flags by listing
them after \fB--\fR\&.

.PP
If the \fBOWNER/\fR portion of the \fBOWNER/REPO\fR repository argument is omitted, it
defaults to the name of the authenticating user.

.PP
When a protocol scheme is not provided in the repository argument, the \fBgit_protocol\fR will be
chosen from your configuration, which can be checked via \fBgh config get git_protocol\fR\&. If the protocol
scheme is provided, the repository will be cloned using the specified protocol.

.PP
If the repository is a fork, its parent repository will be added as an additional
git remote called \fBupstream\fR\&. The remote name can be configured using \fB--upstream-remote-name\fR\&.
The \fB--upstream-remote-name\fR option supports an \fB@owner\fR value which will name
the remote after the owner of the parent repository.

.PP
If the repository is a fork, its parent repository will be set as the default remote repository.


.SH OPTIONS
