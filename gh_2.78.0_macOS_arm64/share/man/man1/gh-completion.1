config file locations might vary based on your system. Make sure to restart your

eval "$(gh completion -s bash)"

Generate a \fB_gh\fR completion script and put it somewhere in your \fB$fpath\fR:

.EX
gh completion -s zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_gh
.EE

.PP
Ensure that the following is present in your \fB~/.zshrc\fR:

autoload -U compinit
