.SH NAME
gh-run-view - View a summary of a workflow run


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgh run view [<run-id>] [flags]\fR


.SH DESCRIPTION
View a summary of a workflow run.

.PP
Due to platform limitations, \fBgh\fR may not always be able to associate jobs with their
corresponding logs when using the primary method of fetching logs in zip format.

.PP
In such cases, \fBgh\fR will attempt to fetch logs for each job individually via the API.
This fallback is slower and more resource-intensive. If more than 25 job logs are missing,
the operation will fail with an error.

.PP
Additionally, due to similar platform constraints, some log lines may not be
associated with a specific step within a job. In these cases, the step name will
appear as \fBUNKNOWN STEP\fR in the log output.
