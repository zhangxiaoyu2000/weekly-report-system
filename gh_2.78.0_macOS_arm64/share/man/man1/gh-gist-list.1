.SH NAME
gh-gist-list - List your gists


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgh gist list [flags]\fR


.SH DESCRIPTION
List gists from your user account.

.PP
You can use a regular expression to filter the description, file names,
or even the content of files in the gist using \fB--filter\fR\&.

.PP
For supported regular expression syntax, see 
\[la]https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax\[ra]\&.

.PP
Use \fB--include-content\fR to include content of files, noting that
this will be slower and increase the rate limit used. Instead of printing a table,
code will be printed with highlights similar to \fBgh search code\fR:

.EX
{{gist ID}} {{file name}}
    {{description}}
        {{matching lines from content}}
.EE

.PP
No highlights or other color is printed when output is redirected.
