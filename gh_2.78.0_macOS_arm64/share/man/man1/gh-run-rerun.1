.SH NAME
gh-run-rerun - Rerun a run


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgh run rerun [<run-id>] [flags]\fR


.SH DESCRIPTION
Rerun an entire run, only failed jobs, or a specific job from a run.

.PP
Note that due to historical reasons, the \fB--job\fR flag may not take what you expect.
Specifically, when navigating to a job in the browser, the URL looks like this:
\fBhttps://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runs/<run-id>/jobs/<number>\fR\&.

.PP
However, this \fB<number>\fR should not be used with the \fB--job\fR flag and will result in the
API returning \fB404 NOT FOUND\fR\&. Instead, you can get the correct job IDs using the following command:

.EX
gh run view <run-id> --json jobs --jq '.jobs[] | {name, databaseId}'
.EE

.PP
You will need to use databaseId field for triggering job re-runs.
