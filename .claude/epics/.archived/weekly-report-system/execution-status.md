## Agent Completion Tracking

**Auto-completion enabled**: ✅ Enhanced epic start with automatic issue closing
**Monitoring scripts**: Available in epic directory
**Completion callbacks**: Configured for all agents
**Status sync**: Automatic on agent completion

### How It Works:
1. When agents complete successfully, issues are automatically closed
2. Epic progress is updated in real-time
3. Failed agents are logged for manual review
4. Dependencies are automatically resolved when prerequisites complete

### Manual Override:
- Force close issue: `bash .claude/scripts/pm/issue-close.sh <issue_num> weekly-report-system`
- Check agent failures: `cat .claude/epics/agent-failures.log`
- Refresh epic status: `/pm:epic-status weekly-report-system`
