## Task: 项目环境搭建和基础架构配置
**Issue:** #001  
**Stream:** Infrastructure & CI/CD  
**Started:** 2025-09-05T09:00:00Z

## Scope
- Files: `.github/workflows/**`, `deploy/**`, `docs/**`
- Work: CI/CD流水线、环境配置管理、部署脚本、代码质量检查

## Progress Status: 🟢 Completed

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Created progress tracking structure
- [x] Analyzed requirements and dependencies
- [x] Configure GitHub Actions workflows
- [x] Create multi-environment configurations (dev/test/prod)
- [x] Set up code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier, lint-staged)
- [x] Create deployment scripts and Docker configurations
- [x] Configure automated testing pipeline
- [x] Create project README and development documentation

### Infrastructure Delivered
- **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Complete CI/CD pipeline with parallel execution
- **Environment Configurations**: Dev/Test/Prod with Docker Compose setups
- **Code Quality Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, lint-staged configurations
- **Deployment Scripts**: Automated deployment and setup scripts
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Performance testing, security scanning, dependency updates
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for development, deployment, and API usage

### Ready for Integration
- CI/CD pipelines are configured to detect backend/frontend projects when they exist
- Environment configurations support both Spring Boot backend and Vue.js frontend
- All infrastructure is ready for Stream A and B integration

### Coordination with Other Streams
- **Ready for Stream A (Backend)**: All backend-related CI/CD configurations are prepared
- **Ready for Stream B (Frontend)**: All frontend-related CI/CD configurations are prepared  
- **Integration Points**: Both streams can now use the deployment scripts and environment configurations
