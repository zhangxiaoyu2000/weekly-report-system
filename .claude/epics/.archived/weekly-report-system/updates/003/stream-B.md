## Dependencies Status
- User entity available from issue #002 ✅
- Spring Security and JWT dependencies available ✅
- **Waiting for Stream A to complete JWT token provider implementation**

## Integration Notes
- All JWT token operations are stubbed with placeholders
- Ready for integration once Stream A completes security configuration
- Controllers have proper error handling and logging
- Services implement comprehensive role-based authorization
